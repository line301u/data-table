## Instructions

```
At Resights we do not only collect a lot of data - we also spend a lot of time structuring and visualizing data.
For that reason, we often spend a lot of time figuring out how to communicate data in the best way.
A very important task for the front-end.

This task will therefore contain a heavily used component at Resights: A DataTable.

You task is therefore, to make the default Vuetify DataTable as usable as possible for the user.

We have only few requirements:
 - It must be possible to filter columns in the table, e.g. Gender-column
 - It must be possible to search records from the table
 - It must be possible to paginate the table. Unfortunatelty, the dataset is 1.000 entries, so we can not load all at once, so you must do server-side pagination.
 - Styling the datatable to communicate data to the user with as little friction as possible.


Besides the mentioned requirements, we appreciate any efforts and suggestions on improvements.


Less is more... Never do something just to do something...
